== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

This plugin allows you to show a leaderboard of your top affiliates. Show any number of affiliates and include their referrals, earnings and visits. You can also order them by referrals, earnings, or visits. Showing an affiliate leaderboard on your website is a great way to encourage affiliates to make you more sales.

**Features:**

1. An [affiliate_leaderboard] shortcode for showing an affiliate leaderboard on any WordPress page
2. An Affiliate Leaderboard widget for showing an affiliate leaderboard in your theme's sidebar
3. A PHP function for developers for showing an affiliate leaderboard anywhere on your site.

**Shortcode Usage**

The defaut shortcode with no additional parameters will show 10 affiliates, ordered by referrals.

    [affiliate_leaderboard]

The `number` parameter can be used to control how many affiliates are shown in the leaderboard:

    [affiliate_leaderboard number="5"]

The `referrals` parameter can be used to show an affiliate's referrals:

    [affiliate_leaderboard referrals="yes"]

The `earnings` parameter can be used to show an affiliate's earnings:

    [affiliate_leaderboard earnings="yes"]

The `visits` parameter can be used to show an affiliate's visits:

    [affiliate_leaderboard visits="yes"]

You can also list all 3 (referrals, earnings, visits) like this:

    [affiliate_leaderboard referrals="yes" earnings="yes" visits="yes"]

The `orderby` parameter can be used to order the leaderboard by either `referrals`, `earnings` or `visits`:
